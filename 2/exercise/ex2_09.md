Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
Define a variable named "input_value" and then intialize the variable with a input value. But the given codes are illegal. Here is the correction.
int input_value;
std::cin >> input_value;
(b) int i = { 3.14 };
Define a variable named "i" and initialize the variable with a value of "3.14". But the given code is illegal. Here is the correction.
int i = 3.14;
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
Define two variables and initialize them with value of 9999.99. The given code is illegal. Here is the correction.
double salary = 9999.99, wage = 9999.99;
(d) int i = 3.14;
Define a variable named "i" and initialize the variable with a value of "3.14".
