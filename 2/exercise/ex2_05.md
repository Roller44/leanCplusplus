Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:
(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
'a' is a char literal, L'a' is a wide character literal, "a" is a string literal, L"a" is a string wide character literal.
(b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC 
10 is a decimal literal, 10u is a unsigned decimal literal, 10L is a long literal, 10uL is a unsigned long decimal, literal, 012 is a octal literal, 0xC is a hexadecimal literal.
(c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L 
3.14 is a floating-point literal, its type is double; 3.14f is a floating-point literal, its type is float; 3.14L is a long floating-point literal, its type is double;
(d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2
10 is a decimal literal, 10u is a unsign decimal literal, 10. is a double literal, 10e-2 is a double literal.
