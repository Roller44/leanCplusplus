Q: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.
A: 1) Rate - signed double. The rate is greater than zero when the mortgage increases, is equal to zero when the mortgate unchanges, and is smaller than zero when the mortage decrease. 2) Principal - char. This principal is a name. 3) Payment - unsigned double. The payment must be greater than or equal to zero and must be a integer or a floating number.
