(a) First change the position of pointer ptr and return the copied
value. Then check whether pointer is null. Finally move the pointer
one step to right again and see if the value which pointer is pointing
is 0.
(b) See if ival is 0 and see ival + 1 is 0.
(c) See if the next variable of vector is bigger or equal to this one.
